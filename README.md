Undergraduate Research project for Fall 2025. Using a Unitree GO1 robot, I attatched a vacumm to GO1 to clean dirty spots on the floor. To detect where a location needs to be cleaned, an Intel Realsense D435i camera with YOLO object detction was attatched to GO1. Below are the steps required to replicate the project. I used ROS2 humble and Ubuntu 22.04, packages used listed as well.
